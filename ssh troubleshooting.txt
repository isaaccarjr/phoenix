Enabled ssh service (systemctl)

sshd config file

For funsies
/etc/ssh/sshd-banner
/etc/motd  

ssh root@127.0.0.1 -L 4444:192.168.159.132:22 -Nf 
ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 4444  

The -L option is only establishing the future connection. You can only interact with it by logging into 4444
on the via 127.0.0.1 (local host)  



We established a working network to work from. Allowing two hosts to talk to each other. Researched ssh_config
file. Got the videos for created local tunnels. Worked on local tunnels with the -L options. Local port forwarding.

A 192.168.159.134 --> B 192.168.159.132
           
Enabled ssh service (systemctl)

sshd config file
-- PermitRootLogin yes 
-- PermitEmptyPasswords yes

Set a password for root 
(sshd_config file had PermitEmptyPasswords set to no) 

For funsies
/etc/ssh/sshd-banner
/etc/motd  

ssh root@127.0.0.1 -L 4444:192.168.159.132:22 -Nf 
ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 4444  

The -L option is only establishing a local port forward for a FUTURE connection. You can only interact with it by logging into it via another ssh session. In this case we logged into B(192.168.159.132) via ssh on port 4444 root@127.0.0.1 (local host).  



We established an internal network to work from. Allowing two hosts to talk to one another. Troubleshot ssh service to allow it to work properly. Researched ssh_config
file settings. Archived video references/resources that covered creating local tunnels. Worked on establishing local tunnels with the -L option (local port forwarding).
